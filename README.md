# ExcerciseRecorder

Create an application, with login and signup that allows users to create workouts and shows them their lifetime stats

Use HTML for the bones, CSS for the makeup and React.JS for the meat of the front-end.

Use Javascript for the fuctionality

Use Node.JS or Express.JS to communicate with some free RDS (try mongoDB or postgreSQL)

Workouts:
  composed of sets of excerices
    excercises are an excericse, have reps, and special notes

Lastly, dockerize the app so it can be downloaded and used on any device
